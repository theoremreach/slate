# Introduction

Welcome to the TheoremReach API documentation! Our API enables you to create and modify research projects on our platform, calculate feasibility, start/stop the flow of sample, and reconcile completes.

# Getting Started

Before you can begin creating survey sample requests using our API, you will need to contact admin@theoremreach.com for an API token. This token will be used for authentication purposes described in the section below.

The first API token that we send you will only grant you access to our staging server, http://api-staging.theoremreach.com. Please use this as your base URL until you are ready to go live.

When you are ready to go live, please contact us for a live api token. Update your routes to point to https://api.theoremreach.com. Please note the use of SSL/HTTPS for production.

Don't hesitate to reach out to admin@theoremreach.com with any questions that arise as part of the implementation! We're happy to help!

# Authentication

We use HTTPS combined with an access_key to enforce access controls to secure resources.


```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries?api_key=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>testkey</code> with your personal API key. The api_key param must appear in every request.

# Integration Guide

## Mapping

The first step of integration is to load and map our data to your system. This will ensure your system is able to properly communicate with our API.  

You must map countries, trait questions and traits before creating any campaigns.

## Campaign Creation

After understanding and creating mappings for the above tables you can start to create a campaign.  When you first create a campaign it will be set to a status of 'Draft'.  Specify the CPI, LOI, Name, and some of the other required pieces of information.  Specifying start and end dates will tell a campaign when to turn on and off.

## Quota Creation

Once the base campaign is created you need to assign your quotas for respondents.  A quota is a stand-alone bucket for which you want to fill a certain demographic.  Each quota works independantly of any other quota.  The campaign will inherit a total quota additive of all active quotas, which you dont need to worry about through the api or manage.  

Once a quota is filled it will automatically inactivate.  If all the quotas are filled it will automatically change the campaign to "Completed".

To change a quota to inactive via the API just the target_completes value to 0.  If you want to open a quota back up and have already filled it, set the target_completes value to a number higher than the remaining_completes count.  If the campaign is Completed you will need to re-enable the campaign. (Set to "In Progress")

## Launch the Campaign

With a valid campaign set up and at least one active quota you can launch the campaign.  Simply set the status to "In Progress".

# Countries

### INDEX - List Available Countries

```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries?api_key=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

> Example RESPONSE JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "id":9,
    "name":"English - United States"
  }
]
```


This end point allows you to retrieve all active country and language combinations currently supported by TheoremReach.  Only actively support countries will be returned.  The ID must be used when creating campaigns and checking feasibility. Please note the beta version of our API only supports our US based sample. Please contact admin@theoremreach.com if you are interested in running international sample requests.

**HTTP REQUEST**

`GET https://api.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries?api_key=testkey`

**REQUIRED PARAMETERS**

`None`

**RESPONSE**

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id | integer | Unique identifier used when making additional feasibility and campaign creation calls
name | string | Name of the country/language combination


# Trait Questions

```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries/9/trait_questions?api_key=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

> Example RESPONSE JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "id":1,
    "question_text":"What is your age?",
    "question_type":"numeric",
    "trait_question_type":"age",
    "country_id":9,
    "can_check_feasibility": true
  },
  {

    "question_type":"numeric",
    "trait_question_type":"zip",
    "country_id":9,
    "can_check_feasibility": false
  }
]
```

Trait questions allow you to check feasibility and build quotas around a respondents profile.  An example trait question may be "What is your age?".  

### INDEX - List Available Trait Questions

# Callbacks

> For a successful completion for a respondent with a passed in id of 12345 redirect respondent to:

```shell
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=10&user_id=12345
```

These are the routes that you redirect a respondent to notify us when to award a user the reward in their app. Note: a respondent must be sent back to one of these routes. Replace the {USER_ID} with the actual ID we pass to you in place of the {USER_ID} in the initial redirect.

Success:
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=10&user_id={USER_ID}

Overquota:
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=3&user_id={USER_ID}

Disqualified:
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=4&user_id={USER_ID}

This end point allows you to update an existing campaign.

Please note - only campaigns with a status of "In Progress" will receive sample. Once a campaign is set to "In Progress" it cannot be set back to "Draft", rather it should be set to "Paused" if you wish to pause receiving sample for that project. 

In order to receive sample you must use this call to set the status to "In Process" and there must be at least one quota that still needs completions.

# Quotas

Quotas are the access control for your campaigns.  Think of them as both the gate keeper and also the ticket counter when entering a concert.  

TheoremReach has simplified the quota process making it easier to understand and construct.  Essentially you build all your requirements of a quota into a single quota and then set the target_completes you desire for that particular.  Quotas are always cumulative.

`Example:`

* 250 - Males Age 18-24
* 250 - Females Age 18-24

In TheoremReach you would create the above scenario with just two quotas adding the appropriate trait questions and trait ids for those requirements.  Once the quota has been filled.  It will be deactivated and no longer allow respondents to even see it as available.  You also do not need to update the campaign with a total quota amount.

In the above example, you will receive 500 respondents for the survey. 250 Males aged 18-24 and 250 Females aged 18-24.


## Index - All Quotas

```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/campaigns/57472/quotas?api_key=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

> Example RESPONSE JSON:

```json

      {
        "1":[18,19,20,21,22,23,24]
      }
  }
]
```

This end point will allow you to fetch all of the quotas for a campaign.

target_completes | integer | Total number of completes you wish for this quota
total_incompletes | integer | Total number of respondents have attempted and failed this quota
