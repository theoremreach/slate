# Introduction

Welcome to the TheoremReach API documentation! Our API enables you to create and modify research projects on our platform, calculate feasibility, start/stop the flow of sample, and reconcile completes.

# Getting Started

Before you can begin creating survey sample requests using our API, you will need to contact admin@theoremreach.com for an API token. This token will be used for authentication purposes described in the section below.

The first API token that we send you will only grant you access to our staging server, http://api-staging.theoremreach.com. Please use this as your base URL until you are ready to go live.

When you are ready to go live, please contact us for a live api token. Update your routes to point to https://api.theoremreach.com. Please note the use of SSL/HTTPS for production.

# Authentication

We use HTTPS combined with an access_key to enforce access controls to secure resources.


```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries?access_token=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>testkey</code> with your personal API key. The access_token param must appear in every request.
</aside>

# Integration Guide

## Mapping

The first step of integration is to load and map our data to your system. This will ensure your system is able to properly communicate with our API.  

You must map countries, trait questions and traits. 

# Countries

### INDEX - List Available Countries

```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries?access_token=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id":9,
    "name":"English - United States"
  }
]
```


This end point allows you to retrieve all active country and language combinations currently supported by TheoremReach.  Only actively support countries will be returned.  The ID must be used when creating campaigns and checking feasibility. Please note the beta version of our API only supports our US based sample. Please contact admin@theoremreach.com if you are interested in running international sample requests.

**HTTP REQUEST**

`GET https://api.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries?access_token=testkey`

**REQUIRED PARAMETERS**

`None`

**RESPONSE**

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
id | integer | Unique identifier used when making additional feasibility and campaign creation calls
name | string | Name of the country/language combination


# Trait Questions

```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/countries/9/trait_questions?access_token=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id":1,
    "question_text":"What is your age?",
    "question_type":"numeric",
    "trait_question_type":"age",
    "country_id":9
  },
  {
    "id":2,
    "question_text":"What is your zip code?",
    "question_type":"numeric",
    "trait_question_type":"zip",
    "country_id":9
  }
]
```

Trait questions allow you to check feasibility and build quotas around a respondents profile.  An example trait question may be "What is your age?".  

### INDEX - List Available Trait Questions

# Callbacks

> For a sucessful completion for a respondent with a passed in id of 12345 redirect respondent to:

```shell
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=10&user_id=12345
```

These are the routes that you redirect a respondent to notify us when to award a user the reward in their app. Note: a respondent must be sent back to one of these routes. Replace the {USER_ID} with the actual ID we pass to you in place of the {USER_ID} in the initial redirect.

Success:
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=10&user_id={USER_ID}

Overquota:
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=3&user_id={USER_ID}

Disqualified:
https://theoremreach.com/respondent_result?status=4&user_id={USER_ID}

```


This end point allows you to update an existing campaign.

Please note - only campaigns with a status of "In Progress" will receive sample. Once a campaign is set to "In Progress" it cannot be set back to "Draft", rather it should be set to "Paused" if you wish to pause receiving sample for that project. 

In order to receive sample you must use this call to set the status to "In Process" and there must be at least one quota that still needs completions.

# Quotas

Quotas are the access control for your campaigns.  Think of them as both the gate keeper and also the ticket counter when entering a concert.  

TheoremReach has simplified the quota process making it easier to understand and construct.  Essentially you build all your requirements of a quota into a single quota and then set the total_completes you desire for that particular.  Quotas are always cumulative.

`Example:`

* 250 - Males Age 18-24
* 250 - Females Age 18-24

In TheoremReach you would create the above scenario with just two quotas adding the appropriate trait questions and trait ids for those requirements.  Once the quota has been filled.  It will be deactivated and no longer allow respondents to even see it as available.  You also do not need to update the campaign with a total quota amount.

In the above example, you will receive 500 respondents for the survey. 250 Males aged 18-24 and 250 Females aged 18-24.


## Index - All Quotas

```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://api-staging.theoremreach.com/api/v1/campaigns/57472/quotas?access_token=30832a87c5bf731cb234fb0f218c1989
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this for a quota of males aged 18-24:

```json
